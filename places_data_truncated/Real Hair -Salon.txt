Real Hair -Salon
Tonii is fantastic.  The salon is wonderfully set up and very relaxing.
She is professional to the core, with a lovely laid back style making you feel rejuvenated, and I guarantee if you have a salon treatment your hair will feel amazing.
Simply can't find enough superlatives to describe both the place and the person.  Well worth the 5 stars and why I continue to be a very happy customer and recommend her to anyone.

My son and I have been coming to Tonii for hair styling for the past 4 years. We have been thoroughly impressed with her professionalism, experience and always enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of the salon. I come away feeling refreshed every time. I would recommend Tonii's salon to anyone looking for a very talented and friendly hair stylist.

Tonii has been my hairdresser since I was at college and in that 20+ years I have never been disappointed with the service.  She always makes you feel welcome and you leave feeling a million dollars. The salon itself is spacious, modern, calm and relaxing.  I would definitely recommend giving Real Hair a call.

I have total confidence in Tonii's abilities and always leave the salon looking and feeling great. Her down-to-earth nature and sense of humour always make it an enjoyable experience.

Toni is passionate at what she does and takes pride in achieving great results... aims to make the best out of hair...visiting is a treat. .. great result, caring...and fun
