Went there a few times, even when we moved out of town. Our sons hair was cut terribly last time and I asked one of the ladies not to cut more than 4 inches off our daughter's hair. She seemed super proud of what looked like 6-7 inches off. Our daughter had beautiful long hair back then. Lovely ladies.... just need to listen.

The Sophisticutz team come highly recommended.  Easy to find, friendly, great salon and fantastic hairdressing experience, we will be back.

Highly not recommended, their apprentice just spoiled my daughter’s hair, terrible cut, just like in the worst internet memes. Just to add in regards the answer below: besides the hairdresser cut it much shorter we discussed, she cut it unevenly with one side clearly shorter than another. Doesn’t look like a professional cut anyway. Thanks for mot charging me though, as I’ll need to spend these money in a professional salon to fix the damage.

Super nice hairstylists and very caring that the result of my curly perm would be perfect and that I would be comfortable during the two hours there.  And it looks great!

Amazing as always. Awesome haircut and colour. Thankyou Kim.
