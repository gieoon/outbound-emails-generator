First time visiting Jenny at Hair-itage and I found her amazing. She was kind and professional and listened to all concerns I had with my hair. She offered some great advice and gave me a lovely haircut at a reasonable price üòç

Awesome service, Awesome cuts, Awesome Price. Been coming here for my haircuts for over 4-years now!

Love this place. Jen is amazing. The pop of colour from her collection its awesome. 100% go here.
