Jojo's Nail & Wax Spa
Went here to get my lashes and brows tinted and was not disappointed. Wasn’t a long waiting time for a time slot and the price was very good. For only $55, you can get a quality tint done and get kind customer service. Really recommend this place

I absolutely in love w my gorgeous nails 💅🏽!!! These have to be my fav so far🥰🥰
Hand designed these off the internet, everything I asked for. Will always come here as my customers always complement my nails❤️ love the service JOJO!!!! Xox

Place is abit unhygienic & I thought charging $48 for a toe (gel) polish & nail shape was steep! Would be reasonable if it was the spa pedicure but I just wanted a quick polish and shape, which was all I got. Won’t be going back & don’t recommend this place.

I guess the saying is you get what you pay for… I had high expectations as the reviews were really good but I had a spa pedicure and it felt really rushed.. I don’t think I was in the chair for longer than 10minutes, also the bottom of my feet feel worse than before I feel like I need another foot scrub and I just got a pedicure yesterday.

Wouldn't recommend. Lying on an unhygienic blanket and head on a pillow with a towel that had hair on it. Untidy, uncomfortable and Jojo was rushing to get to other clients so I had a huge bruise on one thigh. $70 for a full leg wax which I thought was expensive. Won't return.
