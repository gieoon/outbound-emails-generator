text: Just as the previous review states...poor service, lack of emotional intelligence when dealing with the circumstances of a case, very low understanding of actual correct law process for the client. Don't recommend...client ends up in prison. Research Tony Bamford from 2015 in news articles explains alot about this firm and his junior associates who should not be allowed near a court

text: Used a guy there called Michael Vespa? What an idiot and cost an arm and a leg. On the day of judgement, he didn't even show up, sent some other wally over who knew absolutely nothing about the case (didn't even have the decency to tell me he wasn't coming)
Was a first offence and teenager at the time. Resulted in a conviction that should never have been. The whole case was handled so wrong in so many ways. In what should have been an open/shut case (possession of a couple grams weed) ruined employment opportunities etc...like they just couldn't be bothered and yet were very quick to chase up payment.
