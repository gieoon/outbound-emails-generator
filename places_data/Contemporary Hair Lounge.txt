text: Used this place as my usual was unavailable. Never again.
Very uncomfortable experience.

When I first entered the couple announced that they knew who I was via a mutal friend, then proceeded to try to negatively gossip about said mutual friend. Which I was not at all interested in.

I have dreadlocks and asked for a simple undercut, which i can say was done well, unfortunately being told
'who would even have this awful hairstyle'
while sitting in the chair was not something I was expecting when I go to any hairdresser.

Following on from that they continued to try and make small talk, which ended up with them asking about my work place, followed up with comments of 'they would never go there'

Safe to say I will not be going back here, nor will I recommend this place to anybody.

text: Highly recommend Belinda! Absolute Gem, nothing but professional, and actually listens to what you want. I travel 3 hrs just to get my hair done by Belinda as I can not stand to pay money for something that I'm not happy with.
