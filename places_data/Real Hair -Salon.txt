text: Tonii is fantastic.  The salon is wonderfully set up and very relaxing.
She is professional to the core, with a lovely laid back style making you feel rejuvenated, and I guarantee if you have a salon treatment your hair will feel amazing.
Simply can't find enough superlatives to describe both the place and the person.  Well worth the 5 stars and why I continue to be a very happy customer and recommend her to anyone.

text: My son and I have been coming to Tonii for hair styling for the past 4 years. We have been thoroughly impressed with her professionalism, experience and always enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of the salon. I come away feeling refreshed every time. I would recommend Tonii's salon to anyone looking for a very talented and friendly hair stylist.

text: Tonii has been my hairdresser since I was at college and in that 20+ years I have never been disappointed with the service.  She always makes you feel welcome and you leave feeling a million dollars. The salon itself is spacious, modern, calm and relaxing.  I would definitely recommend giving Real Hair a call.
