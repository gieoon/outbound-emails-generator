text: Ridiculously expensive services.
One of the associates (Elly Fleming) charged me $100 for a single email with ‘Thank you’ written on it. They charge you more than $100 per email and a minute call.
Your visa application total services charges will go beyond $10,000.
Very expensive even for small jobs.
Would never recommend to anyone.

text: Shop around first.
The partner I used lacked basic skill but can bill for things not actually asked for. Well skilled in itemising things in the invoice to make it look busy though so probably deserve 5 stars for that.

text: Mike and Jing Jing help us with our residency visa application. We were very pleased with their friendly and professional manner and responsiveness.

Working with them has helped reduce the pains of the application process and we could not be happier.

Would highly recommend to anyone looking to apply for visa's.

text: I would seriously recommend asking for a quote in writing before engaging this firm. I found the basic knowledge of company law lacking from the Partner I used - which led to unnecessary additional charges for me. The double handling between junior and senior partners seems to be a common practice way of overcharging. I was stunned to find I was charged for an indemnity created to protect the lawyers from me making a claim against them? Make sure you request an itemised invoice - i received a bill before any actual work was presented in the form on one invoice line for a couple of thousand dollars - tell me what other supplier of services would think that was professional?
