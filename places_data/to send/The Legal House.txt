From start to finish they have been amazing even during a snap lockdown.
Open and upfront pricing policies and Pauline has been wonderful to deal with in particular as she has had to answer our myriad of questions

text: Thanks so much to Josh, Pauline and the Legal House for helping us with the sale of our apartment - they are so great to deal with and gave us some great advice re selling privately - could not have done it without their knowledge.
