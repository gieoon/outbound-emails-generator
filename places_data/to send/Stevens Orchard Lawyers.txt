text: Hellena and Margot were professional, efficient, and informative. The service fee was far less than I anticipated given the high quality of their work. Would highly recommend this firm.
Thank you

text: Margot and the team at Stevens Orchard Lawyers in Stoke, Nelson were able to help me with purchasing my new residential investment property.  They conducted a title search and advised me on what to look out for and what conditions to put in my sale and purchase agreement. If you are a first home buyer or an investor buying homes I would highly recommend them.

text: Very poor service, I have been with this firm for 20 years but in the last 5 years it has taken a very bad turn and I no longer do bussnius with them, there rates are extremely inflated for the service you get which comes with very bad emails and advise which is not correct.
If you are looking for a firm for day to day bussnius, wills, POA, house and trust matters I would look else were there are far better services out there.
I would not recommend this firm to any body at all.
