text: Recently stayed at The Tides Hotel and was really impressed. I've spent 10 years working in boutique hotels on Australia and for a small town like Nelson the Tides is punching above it's weight. The room was lovely and vibrant, with a balcony and small chairs/table. There was ample space to hang clothes and store my suitcase. The room itself was spacious and the decor was really nice, with a beautiful feature wall. The TV was well positioned and there was a small desk for me to do some work. The bathroom was very impressive, a full spa bath and some nice amenities. The spa crystals were a nice touch too.

The restaurant downstairs offered a great range of beer and wine and the food was really enjoyable too. The breakfast offering was really nice and the ladies who work the breakfast shift were super bubbly and friendly. It makes such a difference when you're travelling for work and the staff are enjoying their jobs, especially in the morning when no one wants to be leaving the hotel! I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and will be sure to recommend it to those that travel to Nelson. It's now my companies preferred location to stay!

Had room service for dinner. Very fast to arrive. Cooked well and very tasty. Wonderful manners on the staff who delivered the food. Looking forward to the rest of our stay with you.
