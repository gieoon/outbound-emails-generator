text: Mike and his Six Step team are stars. I would highly recommend them to anyone. They spent a lot of time to totally understand your requirements, asking the hard but right questions, which we sometimes don't want to answer or think about. Their knowledge of the Life protection industry is extraordinary and extensive.  Protecting your life and lifestyle is vital today, and Mike and his team provided the expert advice on choosing the right protection for our particular circumstances. And since the world constantly challenges us and our lives, Six Step were very proactive to review and adjust our insurance to ensure we had the right level of protection for the right cost.

text: I fell and injured my back 3 years ago, I had heath insurance that Mike arranged for me when I first arrived in NZ.
After falling and ACC rejecting my claim Mike stepped into action and arranged my insurance claim hassle free.
