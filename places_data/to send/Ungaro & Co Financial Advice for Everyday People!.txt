text: Very good advice financially and a likable, genuine, sincere person. Darcy is very professional and he treats your time as just as valuable as his is. He has educated himself in lots of different avenues of financial advice and tries to give you an overall perspective from all the objective viewpoints so that you can make the best decision for yourself. You can tell he cares and takes the time to understand your situation and find your best possible paths forward in the direction you choose. I would definitely and have recommended working with him to understand your financial options better to improve your financial life.
His podcasts are also great as well…!
Thanks again, Darcy!

text: We've been clients of Ungaro & Co for over 6+ years and highly recommend Darcy & his team.  From the initial meeting, creating our financial plan and helping us understand our financial personalities was enlightening - Darcy has a knack for explaining financial matters in such a easy way we've always felt empowered and confident with our choices. Unlike going direct to the bank having Darcy check in annually and having our best interests at the forefront is why we have remained loyal clients of Ungaro & Co over the years.

text: Great experience talking to Darcy, absolutely recommend for any of your financial needs, extensive knowledge in the field and very easy to talk to. With all the fake information around the internet and people giving advice for their own gain it’s difficult to find someone who actually cares about their customers but look no further because Ungaro and co have got you covered.
