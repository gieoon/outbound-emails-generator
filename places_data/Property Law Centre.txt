text: Really professional work. More than happy to pay the amount we agreed for Michael's services. Michael is very experienced and friendly and was happy to walk me through the various mundane forms we needed to fill out. His actions were very timely and thorough. Use property Law Centre first.

text: Hi.
We've used Michael Ducray about four times and have always found him friendly and great to deal with. I like the way he gets straight down to business, is efficient and really clear about the process and what is required.
I recommend him to friends .

text: Just rang up to get ask for a quote on buying some land off a neighbour,  cut me off whilst I was talking, said he couldn't give a fixed fee.  Wasn't even prepared to listen to what I had to say.  Really rude and arrogant in his whole manner.  Do not bother ringing.  There is a reason they have low reviews.
