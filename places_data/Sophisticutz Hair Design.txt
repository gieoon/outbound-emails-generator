text: Went there a few times, even when we moved out of town. Our sons hair was cut terribly last time and I asked one of the ladies not to cut more than 4 inches off our daughter's hair. She seemed super proud of what looked like 6-7 inches off. Our daughter had beautiful long hair back then. Lovely ladies.... just need to listen.

text: Highly not recommended, their apprentice just spoiled my daughter’s hair, terrible cut, just like in the worst internet memes. Just to add in regards the answer below: besides the hairdresser cut it much shorter we discussed, she cut it unevenly with one side clearly shorter than another. Doesn’t look like a professional cut anyway. Thanks for mot charging me though, as I’ll need to spend these money in a professional salon to fix the damage.

text: Super nice hairstylists and very caring that the result of my curly perm would be perfect and that I would be comfortable during the two hours there.  And it looks great!
