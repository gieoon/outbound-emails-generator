text: I had the most amazing experience, getting half head of foils, i was talked through the whole process.  I got layers done and i felt and looked like a million dollars. I had strangers commenting on how stunning my hair looked and felt, it was so soft to the touch not dry at all.I really can't recommend Megan highly enough.

text: Went for a new "do" for going home to Scotland. Colour not as I asked, in fact almost the opposite of what I asked. The Perm ruined my hair.. seriously overprocessed despite my warnings that my hair perms REALLY quickly. Had to spend a fortune on deep conditioning treatments at a salon in Scotland to try to restore some condition. The stylist there was horrified at how bad it was. Asked if it had been a trainee who did it. This ruined my holiday.

text: This business is a gem.From the lovely phone reception from Jess when enquiring if we could have our haircuts to the warm welcome when we arrived. Both Jess and Maz did an incredible cut and style and blowwave ,  listening very attentively to our needs. Both given a cuppa and we would so highly recommend this hairdresser to all. We will definitely be back when in the area . Thank you so much Jess and Maz was lovely to meet you. ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏èüöåüíáüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

text: I love having my hair cut and styled at McIntyre is Hair.  Everyone is so friendly and the cuts are always excellent.  I particularly enjoy the decor of the salon - a touch of French style.  Cherie and her staff are very talented and I always come away feeling better than when I went in.
