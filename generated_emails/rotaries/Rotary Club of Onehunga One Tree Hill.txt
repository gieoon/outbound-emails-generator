Hello Rotary Club of Onehunga One Tree Hill,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Jun Kagaya from Webbi Digital Studio, a local New Zealand website design agency. I've taken a look at your online presence, and I admire the work you do for the community.

Like you, we at Webbi Digital Studio are passionate about making a positive impact. We strive to create websites that not only look great but also serve a real purpose. Your organization's dedication to service and community is something we deeply respect and I believe we could enhance how you connect with your audience through a refreshed, conversion-focused website.

Our teams' core values align, and I am excited about the possibility of helping your club extend its reach. I would love to discuss how we can work together to create a website that reflects the vibrant spirit of the Rotary Club of Onehunga One Tree Hill.

If you're interested in learning more, please feel free to check out our portfolio on our homepage. And of course, I'm just an email or phone call away if you want to chat about potential ideas.

Warmest regards,

Jun Kagaya,
