Hello Takapuna Rotary Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Jun Kagaya from Webbi Digital Studio, a fellow New Zealand-based company specializing in creating websites that not only look great but also drive engagement and growth.

I came across your site and see that we share a commitment to serving our community â€“ you through your rotary club efforts and we by helping local organizations like yours shine online.

If you're open to it, I'd love to discuss how we can refresh the Takapuna Rotary website to enhance user experience, strengthen your online presence, and elevate your community outreach.

Take a look at our work on www.webbi.co.nz to see how we've transformed other brands. I'm confident we can do the same for yours.

Looking forward to the possibility of working together.

Best regards,

Jun Kagaya,
Web Designer, Webbi Digital Studio
