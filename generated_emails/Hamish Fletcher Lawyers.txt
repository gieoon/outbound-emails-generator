Hi there,

I hope this message finds you well amid the exciting news of Smythes Lawyers merging with Hamish Fletcher Lawyers. As a fellow New Zealand-based business, I understand the importance of a strong online presence, particularly during a time of growth and change.

I'm Jun Kagaya from Webbi Digital Studio, and we specialize in creating conversion-focused websites that not only look great but also grow your brand. The synergy between our companies is clear; just as you provide expert legal advice, we deliver bespoke web design solutions tailored to professional firms like yours.

I've taken a look at your current website and see a fantastic opportunity to enhance your online platform to reflect the new breadth of your merged firm. We would love to bring your website up to the same high standard as the legal services you provide.

If you are interested, let's discuss how we can support your digital journey. Our portfolio can give you a glimpse of what we can achieve together: https://www.webbi.co.nz.

Thanks for considering this, and I look forward to potentially collaborating with you!
