Greetings!

I hope this message finds you well. I’m Jun Kagaya from Webbi Digital Studio, and I couldn't help but admire the community-focused work that the Rotary Club of Half Moon Bay does. It's inspiring to see such dedication to service and fellowship.

Like the Rotary Club, our agency, Webbi Digital Studio, is based in New Zealand and we value building strong community ties. Our goal is to help local brands and organizations like yours reach their full potential online.

I’ve noticed that while your website provides valuable information, there might be room for enhancements that could further engage your members and the local community. I'd love the opportunity to discuss how a revitalized website can support your Club's goals.

If this is something you’re open to, please flick me a message, and let’s chat about taking your online presence to the next level.

Warm regards,

Jun Kagaya,
Web Designer, Webbi Digital Studio
