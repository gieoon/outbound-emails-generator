Hi Rotary Club of Auckland Harbourside team,

I hope this message finds you well! I'm Jun Kagaya from Webbi Digital Studio, right here in New Zealand. I've been admiring the wonderful community work your club has been doing for our beautiful Auckland city.

As a fellow Kiwi organization dedicated to making a positive impact, I wanted to reach out and offer our services at Webbi Digital Studio to help elevate the Rotary Club of Auckland Harbourside's online presence. Just like you, we believe in doing our best to contribute positively to our community, and one way we do that is by building websites that grow brands and connect people.

Our portfolio at Webbi Digital Studio is a testament to our commitment to quality and effectiveness. We would be thrilled to bring the same level of care and professionalism to a new or improved website for your club, ensuring your online representation matches the amazing work you do offline.

Thank you for considering this partnership. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we can support the Rotary Club of Auckland Harbourside's digital journey.

Best regards,

Jun Kagaya,
Web Designer, Webbi Digital Studio
