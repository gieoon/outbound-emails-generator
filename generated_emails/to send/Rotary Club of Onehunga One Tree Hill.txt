Hello Rotary Club of Onehunga One Tree Hill team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Jun Kagaya and I run Webbi Digital Studio, a local NZ website design agency. I've been admiring the community work your club does and as a fellow Kiwi organization, I understand the importance of a strong online presence in promoting our local initiatives.

I took a look at your current website and noticed some great potential to further reflect the impactful work you do. Our approach at Webbi Digital Studio is to create websites that not only look good but also drive engagement and growth.

We've worked with organizations similar to yours and have helped them enhance their digital footprint. Check out our samples on our home page to see how a refreshed website could amplify your club's reach and mission.

Let's get in touch to discuss how we can collaborate to keep the Rotary Club of Onehunga One Tree Hill thriving online and offline.

Best regards,

Jun Kagaya, 
Web Designer, Webbi Digital Studio
