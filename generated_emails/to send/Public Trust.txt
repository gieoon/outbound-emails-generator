Content:

Hi there,

I hope this message finds you well. I've had the opportunity to explore Public Trust NZ’s website and wanted to commend you on your commitment to providing crucial services like wills, EPAs, and trust management. It’s evident that helping people manage their estates with ease and confidence is a shared passion for our companies.

I'm Alex Kagaya from Webbi Digital Studio, a like-minded New Zealand-based web design agency that takes pride in crafting websites that not only look great but perform excellently. We focus on creating platforms that enhance user experience and engagement, characteristics that are essential for a service-based company like Public Trust.

Considering the overlap in our goals – making complex services more accessible and trustworthy – I believe a collaboration could be highly beneficial. Whether it’s refining the user journey or implementing the latest design trends, we’re here to help Public Trust stand out even more in the digital space.

Feel free to take a peek at our work at https://www.webbi.co.nz. I’d love to discuss how we could contribute to the ongoing success of Public Trust.

Looking forward to the possibility of working together.

Warm regards,

Alex Kagaya,
Web Designer, Webbi Digital Studio
