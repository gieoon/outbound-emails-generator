Hello East Coast Bays Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm Alex Kagaya from Webbi Digital Studio, and like you, we are proud to call New Zealand our home. We similarly believe in taking local action to enable global visions.

I've admired your community-driven initiatives and I feel our company's knack for designing websites that grow brands could amplify your impact. Through a fresh online presence, we can potentially engage more volunteers and benefactors for East Coast Bays Rotary.

Please take a moment to view our portfolio at https://www.webbi.co.nz. Together, we can make sure your digital footprint is as expansive and positive as the work you do.

Looking forward to the opportunity to discuss this further.

Warm regards,

Alex Kagaya,
Web Designer, Webbi Digital Studio
